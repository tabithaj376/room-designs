The response time i dont mind that much because i know if i look for 1ms that will even drive the price up ever more. The deals we find on budget gaming pcs between $500 and $1,000 should be able to play most modern games at 1080p and at decent graphical settings. You could save yourself a few bucks with a 2xxx series cpu, or for roughly the same price, gain a few cores (the 2700x is a great deal, for example). A typical gaming pc will cost you between $800 and $1,200.
